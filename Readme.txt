This program was developed for the Graduation Team in the Records Department for WGU.

While reviewing a graduation application from a student in the Teachers Colledge we have to make sure that the student has taken and passed the external exams required for licensure
in their programs.  As each state and each program have different requirements I developed it was a long processes for us on the Grad Team to go to the Student Handbook, scroll through
a long list of states and then another long list of programs to get to the correct article to find the required exams.  And the requirements change fairly frequently so we could not just
memorize them.  

This program cuts out a ton of time navigating the studnet handbook.  After initially entering your initials and selecting option 2 you then type the state code you are looking for and the
program code of the student.  This takes you to the article page which gives the note we would need to document on our graduation application review and it also opens the correct article for
you in the default web browser.  This helped us by making finding the correct article way more efficient.  It used to take 45-90 seconds to find the right article down to less than 10 seconds. 

On the main page selecting option 1 takes you to our cheat sheet of showing which programs fell into which category of licensure and gives you the option to go back or go to a generalized article for
the secondary licensure types.
